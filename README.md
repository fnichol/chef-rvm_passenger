# <a name="title"></a> chef-rvm_passenger [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fnichol/chef-rvm_passenger.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/fnichol/chef-rvm_passenger)

## <a name="description"></a> Description

Installs passenger gem via RVM and configures Apache or Nginx.

## <a name="usage"></a> Usage

Comming soon...

## <a name="requirements"></a> Requirements

### <a name="requirements-chef"></a> Chef

Tested on 0.9.18, 0.10.2 and 0.10.4 but newer and older version should work
just fine. File an [issue][issues] if this isn't the case.

### <a name="requirements-platform"></a> Platform

The following platforms have been tested with this cookbook, meaning that
the recipes run on these platforms without error:

* ubuntu (10.04/10.10/11.04)
* debian (6.0)
* suse
* centos (5/6)
* redhat (5/6)

Please [report][issues] any additional platforms so they can be added.

### <a name="requirements-cookbooks"></a> Cookbooks

This cookbook depends on the following external cookbooks:

* [rvm][rvm_cb]
* [nginx][nginx_cb] (Opscode)
* [apache2][apache2_cb] (Opscode)

## <a name="installation"></a> Installation

Depending on the situation and use case there are several ways to install
this cookbook. All the methods listed below assume a tagged version release
is the target, but omit the tags to get the head of development. A valid
Chef repository structure like the [Opscode repo][chef_repo] is also assumed.

### <a name="installation-librarian"></a> Using Librarian

[Librarian-Chef][librarian] is a bundler for your Chef cookbooks.
Include a reference to the cookbook in a [Cheffile][cheffile] and run
`librarian-chef install`. To install Librarian-Chef:

    gem install librarian
    cd chef-repo
    librarian-chef init

To reference the Git version:

    cat >> Cheffile <<END_OF_CHEFFILE
    cookbook 'rvm_passenger',
      :git => 'https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm_passenger', :ref => 'v0.8.2'
    END_OF_CHEFFILE
    librarian-chef install

### <a name="installation-kgc"></a> Using knife-github-cookbooks

The [knife-github-cookbooks][kgc] gem is a plugin for *knife* that supports
installing cookbooks directly from a GitHub repository. To install with the
plugin:

    gem install knife-github-cookbooks
    cd chef-repo
    knife cookbook github install fnichol/chef-rvm_passenger/v0.8.2

### <a name="installation-tarball"></a> As a Tarball

If the cookbook needs to downloaded temporarily just to be uploaded to a Chef
Server or Opscode Hosted Chef, then a tarball installation might fit the bill:

    cd chef-repo/cookbooks
    curl -Ls https://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm_passenger/tarball/v0.8.2 | tar xfz - && \
      mv fnichol-chef-rvm_passenger-* rvm_passenger

### <a name="installation-gitsubmodule"></a> As a Git Submodule

A dated practice (which is discouraged) is to add cookbooks as Git
submodules. This is accomplishes like so:

    cd chef-repo
    git submodule add git://github.com/fnichol/chef-rvm_passenger.git cookbooks/rvm_passenger
    git submodule init && git submodule update

**Note:** the head of development will be linked here, not a tagged release.

### <a name="installation-platform"></a> From the Opscode Community Platform

This cookbook is not currently available on the site as it relies on a cookbook
([rvm][rvm_cb]) not available on the community site.

## <a name="recipes"></a> Recipes

### <a name="recipes-default"></a> default

Installs dependencies and contains helpers for other recipes.

### <a name="recipes-apache2"></a> apache2

Installs passenger as an apache2 module. Requires the `apache2` recipe.

### <a name="recipes-nginx"></a> nginx

Installs passenger as an nginx module. Requires the `nginx::source` recipe.

## <a name="attributes"></a> Attributes

### <a name="attributes-version"></a> version

The version of passenger to deploy. This will be in a format used by the gem
command. For example:

    node['rvm_passenger']['version'] = "3.0.8"

Default is the most current version which is queried dynamically from RubyGems.

### <a name="attributes-rvm-ruby"></a> rvm_ruby

The RVM ruby (and optional gemset) under which to install the passenger gem.
For example:

    node['rvm_passenger']['rvm_ruby'] = "ruby-1.8.7-p352@passenger"

Default is the default RVM Ruby in a gemset called "passenger", i.e.
`"#{node['rvm']['default_rvm']}@passenger"`.

### <a name="attributes-root-path"></a> root_path

Optionally override the full path to the root of the installed passenger gem.

### <a name="attributes-module-path"></a> module_path

Optionallly override the full path to the Apache2 module.

### <a name="attributes-directives"></a>directives

Server-wide configuration settings. For example:

    node['rvm_passenger']['directives']['apache'] = {
        "PassengerUserSwitching" => "Off"
        "PassengerDefaultUser" => "nobody"
    }

    node['rvm_passenger']['directives']['nginx'] = {
        "passenger_user_switching" => "off"
        "passenger_default_user" => "nobody"
    }

Disable user switching and set the passenger default user to nobody. Both are only valid in server-scope configuration (http block for nginx and server context for Apache).
